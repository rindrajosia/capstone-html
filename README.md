# Capstone-html: Online Shop for Electronics
HTML &amp; CSS capstone project: Online shop for electronics

# Description
  * In this project I built a Responsive Web-page design with HTML and CSS.
  * The website is structured according to this layout, designed by **[Mohammed Awad](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX)**
  * It's a 2-pages website, which includes the main page and the search result page.
  * The web-page is responsive in 2 different screen sizes:
    1. Mobile version : up to 768px;
    2. Tablet & desktop: from 768px;
